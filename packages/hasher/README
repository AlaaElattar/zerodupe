# Hasher Package

The hasher package provides functions for calculating hashes for file and chunk data. It is used by both the client and server to ensure data integrity.

## Functions

### CalculateChunkHash

```go
func CalculateChunkHash(data []byte) string
```

Calculates the SHA-256 hash of a byte slice representing a chunk of data.

### SplitFileIntoChunks

```go
func SplitFileIntoChunks(filePath string) ([]FileChunk, string, error)
```

Reads a file and splits it into chunks. Returns a slice of `FileChunk` structs, the file hash, and any error encountered.

### VerifyChunkHash

```go
func VerifyChunkHash(data []byte, expectedHash string) (bool, string)
```

Verifies that a chunk's data matches its expected hash. Returns a boolean indicating whether the hash matches and the actual hash calculated from the data.
